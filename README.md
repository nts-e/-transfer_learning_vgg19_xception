# Transfer Learning for Pneumonia Classification with VGG19 and Xception in Keras

This GitHub project focuses on pneumonia classification in Chest X-Ray Images using transfer learning. The model is based on a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and employs VGG19 and Xception for binary classification. Implementation is done with Keras, and the F1 scores achieved are 0.975 for VGG19 and 0.968 for Xception. Check it out for a straightforward, effective approach to image classification with pre-trained models.
